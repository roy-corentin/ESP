[[file:img/leitner_box.png]]

* Introduction
InnovateSphere presents an efficient study method inspired by Sebastian Leitner's spaced repetition technique. This method optimizes learning through organized review intervals, ensuring better retention and recall.

* Sebastian Leitner (1919 â€“ 1989)
Sebastian Leitner, a German commentator and Science Popularizer, devised the spaced repetition technique. His method revolutionizes learning by employing spaced intervals for effective memorization.

* Understanding the Leitner Method
The core principle involves using multiple boxes, each with a different review period. Here's how it works:

** How It Works
- Utilizes multiple boxes, each with increasing review intervals.
- When you answer correctly, the card progresses to the next box.
- An incorrect answer results in the card moving back to the initial box for revision.
